\label{sec:futurework}

We have identified several directions along which \Predator{} could be enhanced.

\paragraph{Use Across the Software Stack.} 
\Predator{}'s architecture should in principle let it detect and predict false sharing in the entire software stack, including hypervisors, operating systems, libraries, and applications using different threading libraries.

\paragraph{Improved Performance.}
\Predator{} currently imposes approximately $6\times$ performance overhead. In the current implementation, every memory access is instrumented with a library call to notify the runtime system. A library call entails not only normal function call overhead but also Global Offset Table (GOT) and/or Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) lookup overhead. We plan to improve \Predator{}'s performance by inserting relevant code directly, rather than via function calls.

\paragraph{Suggest Fixes.} Finally, we would like to enhance \Predator{}'s reporting. We believe that leveraging memory trace information will make it possible for \Predator{} to prescribe fixes to the programmer to help them eliminate false sharing.
